Perfect move. If the architecture is the product, the naming has to signal **platform > agency > single app**.

Here are **5 strong naming options** with initial purpose statements that include all your verticals under one venture-engine umbrella.

## 1) **Sovereign Venture Engine (SVE)**

**Purpose (initial):**
Sovereign Venture Engine is an autonomous business foundry that designs, launches, and scales high-performance AI-native companies from a shared bare-metal Rust orchestration core. It unifies six verticals—Security Gateway, Expert Agents, Legacy Surgeon modernization, Companion 2.0 continuity systems, Bare Metal IaaS, and the Venture Intelligence layer—into one modular platform that converts technical architecture into repeatable commercial outcomes.

**Why it works:** clear, powerful, investor-friendly, platform-first.

## 2) **Phoenix Forge Ventures**

**Purpose (initial):**
Phoenix Forge Ventures is a venture studio platform that transforms complex enterprise pain points into production-ready AI businesses through a single orchestrated infrastructure stack. The platform operates across six integrated verticals: secure AI gateway services, domain expert agent systems, legacy system transformation, digital continuity/companion solutions, bare-metal AI infrastructure services, and centralized venture operations for market intelligence, deployment automation, and financial optimization.

**Why it works:** emotional brand equity + “forge” implies creation and execution.

---

## 3) **Jamey Venture OS**

**Purpose (initial):**
Jamey Venture OS is an autonomous operating system for building and running multiple AI-first businesses from one shared backend foundation. It standardizes go-to-market, rapid front-end deployment, and performance tracking across six verticals: AI security gateway products, expert-agent subscriptions, legacy modernization services, companion continuity offerings, bare-metal infrastructure-as-a-service, and portfolio-level venture management.

**Why it works:** direct tie to your orchestrator identity; productized operating-system framing.

---

## 4) **Titan Foundry AI**

**Purpose (initial):**
Titan Foundry AI is a multi-vertical venture engine that spawns specialized, revenue-generating AI companies through reusable orchestration, deployment, and sales automation primitives. Its portfolio includes Security Gateway solutions, Expert Agent platforms, Legacy Surgeon transformation programs, Companion 2.0 premium services, Bare Metal IaaS offerings, and a sovereign management layer that allocates resources by real-time ROI.

**Why it works:** enterprise-grade, broad-market appeal, “foundry” maps well to studio model.

---

## 5) **Aegis Sovereign Studio**

**Purpose (initial):**
Aegis Sovereign Studio is a secure-by-design venture studio that builds AI businesses as modular plugins on a unified bare-metal core. The studio’s verticals include AI security token gateway services, professional expert-agent systems, legacy estate modernization, digital companion continuity solutions, high-performance bare-metal AI infrastructure, and an internal venture command system for market sensing, deployment orchestration, and capital allocation.

**Why it works:** security-forward tone (“Aegis”), studio positioning, strong enterprise credibility.
