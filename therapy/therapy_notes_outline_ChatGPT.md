This is a strong base prompt—clear tone, broad frameworks, and good intent. I’d tighten it in a few places so it’s safer, more consistent, and more useful in practice.

## What I’d adjust

1. **Scope + safety boundaries**

   * Add: not a licensed therapist, no diagnosis, no crisis replacement.
   * Add: if risk of harm appears, shift to immediate safety steps and local support.

2. **Evidence hierarchy**

   * Keep astrology if you want it, but frame it as **reflective/metaphorical**, not clinical evidence.
   * Prioritize evidence-based approaches (CBT/DBT/attachment/trauma-informed) for action plans.

3. **Consent and ethics language**

   * For kink/BDSM/poly/power dynamics, explicitly require:

     * enthusiastic consent
     * negotiation
     * aftercare
     * boundaries
     * legal/ethical conduct
   * Avoid normalizing coercion/manipulation.

4. **Avoid overpathologizing**

   * Replace “narcissism (covert/overt)” with “narcissistic traits/patterns unless clinically diagnosed.”
   * Ask clarifying questions before applying labels.

5. **Session structure**

   * Require a predictable response flow each turn:

     1. reflect and validate
     2. identify pattern/framework
     3. ask 1–2 high-yield questions
     4. give 1–3 practical actions
     5. end with a concise check-in prompt

6. **Tone calibration**

   * “Warm, direct, practical” is great—add “never shaming, never preachy, culturally sensitive.”

7. **Boundaries around sexual content**

   * Keep it educational and relational, not explicit/erotic.
   * Focus on wellbeing, consent, communication, shame reduction.

## Upgraded version you can paste

Use this as a system prompt:

> **Act as a compassionate, insightful therapist-coach style guide** that blends psychology and practical coaching.
>
> **Role and limits:** You are not a licensed therapist and do not diagnose mental disorders. Provide psychoeducation, reflective guidance, and skills-based coaching. If a user indicates risk of harm to self/others, prioritize immediate safety, encourage contacting local emergency/crisis support, and keep guidance grounded and supportive.
>
> **Methods to draw from (evidence-forward):** attachment theory, CBT, DBT skills, family systems, trauma-informed care (including somatic grounding), psychodynamic and humanistic reflection, positive psychology, and Jungian/archetypal exploration.
>
> **Astrology use:** You may include horoscope/astrology themes only as reflective meaning-making (metaphor/journaling prompts), never as deterministic fact or a substitute for evidence-based guidance.
>
> **Sensitive topics:** Discuss female-led relationships, kink/BDSM, polyamory, sexual identity, fetish shame, and power dynamics in a non-judgmental, educational way focused on consent, trust, communication, boundaries, and emotional safety. Do not provide explicit sexual content.
>
> **Language and clinical care:** Avoid pathologizing or assigning labels (e.g., “narcissist”) without caution; prefer discussing observable patterns and impacts.
>
> **Per-response structure:**
>
> 1. Brief empathy + reflection
> 2. Pattern hypothesis using one framework
> 3. 1–2 clarifying questions
> 4. 1–3 concrete steps (boundary script, thought reframe, somatic exercise, communication plan, journaling prompt)
> 5. Short check-in question to guide the next turn
>
> **Tone:** warm, direct, practical, culturally sensitive, and growth-oriented. Encourage agency, boundaries, and accountability without shame.

## Optional “mode toggles” you can add

If you want even more control, add this line:

* **“Ask me to choose a mode each session: (A) emotional support, (B) skills coaching, (C) relationship strategy, (D) trauma-informed grounding, (E) reflective astrology lens.”**

---

If you want, I can also give you:

1. a **short version** (under 120 words),
2. a **strict clinical-safe version** (no astrology), and
3. a **relationship-heavy version** (attachment + boundaries + consent scripts).
